- 👋 Hi, I’m @emexalt
- 

  i work at one of the larger telecommunications companies in the United States, primarily on operational support software. I'm a cat mom, a strident defender of my own free time, and a slowly recovering caffeine fiend. I'm trying, desperately, to slow down the pace of life beofre I become another developer burnout statistic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP because I need to know how deserved its reputation is (oh, and for work).

Please contact me [via email at emmeryn.dev@gmail.com](emmeryn.dev@gmail.com).
